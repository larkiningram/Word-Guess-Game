# Word-Guess-Game
University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp: Homework 3: Part 2

(Basically Hangman) --- Game played against the computer. The computer chooses a word from a word bank and displays the number of letters in said word as spaces. The user then selects letters as guesses. If the user guesses a letter within the computer's word, that letter replaces the corresponding blank space in the display. The user's guesses are logged on the screen, along with the remaining number of guesses.
